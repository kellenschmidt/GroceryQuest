## description
Our app allows grocery shoppers to create a grocery list,  and then find the most efficient path in the store to  collect all the items on their list. A path is generated and  displayed over a map of the grocery store, and items can be  crossed off the list as they are collected.
---
While grocery shopping, people tend to either back track while 
locating the items on their list, or they do not know where a 
particular item is, causing them to waste time.
